# VTK_programs
Precondition: To Run these programs you need visual studio an You will have to build VTK libraries using 
script vtkbuild.cmd It makes use of cmake . You will have to make some changes in copydlls script so that 
it refers to the correct path for copying dlls 


These are some of my VTK programs that I tried while playing around with VTK and learning basics

You sould use vtkprogramsbuild.cmd script to build all programs in one go.
You can use copydlls.cmd to copy vtk dlls in release folder so that programs can be run

If you use visual studio ro run your programs then you don't have to do anything
If you run executable by double clicking on exe files then you should copy data folder inside build folder.

Note : Some of the programs do not compile as they are legacy programs
