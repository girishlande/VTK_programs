THis project ensurest that topoview remains on top of other 3D items in the world space. 
Such as sphere. 
SO we moved sphere position in +Z and -Z and also increased its size and still topo view was rendered on top of 
it. THis proves that 2D actor like Text and such views will always be drawn on top of other geometry
